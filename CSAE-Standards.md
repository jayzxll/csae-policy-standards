# Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Policy and Standards

## Purpose
This document outlines our app's commitment and operational standards for preventing and responding to child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) on our platform.

## 1. Zero Tolerance Policy
We have a zero-tolerance policy toward any form of CSAE content or behavior. This includes imagery, communication, grooming behavior, and related actions.

## 2. Detection and Moderation
- **Automated Detection:** We use AI-based tools to detect CSAE content, including PhotoDNA and hash-matching databases.
- **Human Moderation:** Our moderation team is trained in identifying and responding to CSAE content, with trauma-informed protocols.

## 3. Reporting Mechanisms
- Users can easily report suspected CSAE content or behavior in-app.
- Reports are reviewed within 24 hours and escalated as needed.

## 4. Collaboration with Authorities
We report verified CSAE content to the appropriate law enforcement bodies and relevant child protection organizations, including:
- NCMEC (National Center for Missing & Exploited Children)
- INHOPE network partners

## 5. Data Retention and Privacy
Data related to CSAE investigations is retained securely for a limited time and shared only with relevant authorities under legal obligation.

## 6. Staff Training
All employees, especially moderators and engineers, receive annual CSAE prevention and response training.

## 7. Transparency
We publish annual transparency reports detailing:
- Number of CSAE reports
- Actions taken
- Collaboration efforts with external entities

## 8. Review and Updates
This policy is reviewed and updated every 12 months or following major regulatory changes.
